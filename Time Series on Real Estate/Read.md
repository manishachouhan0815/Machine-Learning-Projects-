# What is real estate data?
## Real estate data gives you information about properties, their purpose, their value, and their ownership. It’s most used by data-driven real estate investors so that they can       make informed decisions about where to invest their money most wisely, based on real-time property values.

What are the sources and collection methods of real estate data?
Real estate data is collected from both public and commercial records that can be found via municipal, realtor, and broker websites or archives. In fact, much of the real estate data out there resides in non-digital paper files, which reduces the amount of publicly available datasets for transaction purposes.
That’s why the demand for third-party real estate data from an authorized vendor is soaring. Vendors use the following sources to compile their databases:

While the impact of proximity might be intuitive, home prices are not just driven by having nearby grocery stores. Rather, they are driven by access to the right quantity, mix, and quality of community features. More is not always better; for example, though having two specialty food stores within a quarter of a mile correlates with an increase in property prices, having more than four of them within that same distance correlates with lower prices.

These nonlinear relationships are observed across many American cities. And the sweet-spot intersection of density and proximity to community amenities varies among cities and even neighborhoods, obscured by a growing mass of data that is increasingly difficult to tame.


This goal of this project is to predict the prices of the house in time by evaluating Real estate data
